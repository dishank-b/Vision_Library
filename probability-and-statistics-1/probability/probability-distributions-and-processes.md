# Probability Distributions & Processes

## Probability Distribution

A probability distribution is a function that describes the likelihood of obtaining the possible values that a random variable can assume. In other words, the values of the variable vary based on the underlying probability distribution.

### General Probability Distribution terms

* Random Variable $$X$$denotes an outcome of some random event. 
* $$p_X(x)$$=  the likelihood that random variable $$X$$ takes a specific value of $$x$$.
* The sum of all probabilities for all possible values must equal 1.
