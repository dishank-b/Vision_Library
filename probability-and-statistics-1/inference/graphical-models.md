# Graphical Models

## Bayesian Networks

These are directed graphs, where there is directed edge between two variables which shows cause-effect relation. 

These are modeled using the conditional probability mostly.

## Markov Networks

These are undirected graphs. Which doesn't necessarily shows cause-effect but rather the connection between variables. 

Using conditional probability in case of _Undirected Graphical Models_ seems erratic because there is no direction and hence no natural conditioning.

In the case of Markov Models, we want to capture the **affinity** between connected random variables.
