# Estimator vs Parameter

A statistic describes samples where as Parameter describes the population. For example, $$\bar x$$ sample mean is an statics where as $$\mu$$ population mean is an parameter. 

Notice the use of different symbols to distinguish estimators\(statistic\) and parameters. More importantly, point estimates and parameters represent fundamentally different things. 

* Point estimates are calculated from the data; parameters are not. 
* Point estimates vary from study to study; parameters do not.
* Point estimates are random variables: parameters are constants.

Statics are estimators which are calculated based on samples to estimate some population parameter.
