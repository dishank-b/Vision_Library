# Chapter 4: Dynamic Programming

* Policy Evaluation \(Prediction\) : First we consider how to compute the state-value function vπ for an arbitrary policy π. This is called policy evaluation in the DP literature. We also refer to it as the prediction problem.
* in this we find the value function of all states for given policy having knowing all environment dynamics. 
* Read the book itself for policy imporvment and policy iteration.
