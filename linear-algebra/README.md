# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is a very beautiful part of mathematics. Where we discuss about vector spaces and their properties. Where we discuss about different characteristics of linear systems and how to solve them. 

One important think about Linear algebra is to able to draw parallel between geometry and arithmetic/algebra. Ability to understand both component on their own and yet able to draw parallel between the two is true understanding for the topic.
