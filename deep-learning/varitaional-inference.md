# Variational Inference

### Summary 

Variational Inference allow us to re-write statistical inference problems \(i.e. infer the value of a random variable given the value of another random variable\) as optimization problems \(i.e. find the parameter values that minimize some objective function\)

When you have intractable probability distribution $$p$$. Variational techniques will try to solve an optimization problem over a class of tractable distributions Q in order to find a q âˆˆ Q that is most similar to p.

For example, we can use **KL divergence** between $$p$$ and $$q$$, so that $$q$$ will be approximate to $$p$$ which intractable, hence we can use $$q$$ in place of $$p$$. 

$$
KL(q||p) = \sum_x q(x)\log \frac{q(x)}{p(x)}
$$

### Graphical Model

Let's say you have some  data denoted by a random variable $$X$$. $$X$$is basically your observed \(I will explain what's meant by observed\) variable. Now we believe that there is some random variable $$Z$$which is responsible for generating $$X$$, but  $$Z$$is hidden/latent i.e. we don't have any information about $$Z$$directly, we just believe that there is some factor/variable $$Z$$ which influence generation of data$$X$$. 

Let's take an example of a factory that manufacture boxes. Now we have  dataset of number of boxes generated by the factory each day over the year. This is our observed variable $$X$$. Why is this called observed variable? Because we have observed this i.e it's given. Now if $$X$$is observed, then something must be not observed in contrast, else why would be specifically call it observed. 

Now think of factors that can affect $$X$$ i.e number of boxes produced in a day. There can be multiple factors which influence $$X$$such as number of workers on that day, number of machines operating that day, morale of workers that day, etc. Let's take random variable $$Z$$which is number of machines working on a day. Now one things to understand is that $$Z$$influence $$X$$, more number of machines working then more number of boxes produced. But the things is that we don't have any data regarding $$Z$$, that's the reason that $$Z$$is called **hidden/latent variable.**

### What we want to achieve?

We want to infer about latent/hidden variable $$Z$$given the variable $$X$$. We want to find how many machine would have been working on some day if I know number of boxes produced that day. For example, if we assume that there is linear relation between machines and number of boxes, then would like to find slope of that relation.

Generally, we assume the model followed by $$Z$$beforehand and solve for the parameters of that model. For example, if I assume that number of machines running follows Gaussian Distribution, then my task is to solve for it's parameters which is mean and variance.
